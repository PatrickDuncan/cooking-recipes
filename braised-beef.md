# Braised Beef

- Do not worry, this recipe will not tell you my life story.
- I think exact ingredients are only necessary for baking.

## Ingredients

- A couple pounds of beef. Short-ribs, chuck roast, blade steak, etc.
- 1 cup of Cabernet Sauvignon red wine.
- A few cups of beef stock.
- A couple tablespoons of soy sauce.
- A couple tablespoons of (red wine) vinegar.
- Vegetable oil, for the low smoke point.
- Half a lemon, squeezed.
- Lots of salt.
- Black pepper.
- Red pepper flakes.
- Your favourite meat seasonings (I use paprika, garlic powder, and onion power).
- Half an onion.
- A few cloves of garlic.
- 1 large carrot.
- 1 tablespoon of flour.
- (Optional) A red bell pepper.
- (Optional) Thyme or other herb.

## Steps

1. Take the beef out of the fridge and cut it up into hand-size pieces, if necessary. Over-salt it on both sides, and keep it out for at least 1 hour.
    - You can do this overnight.
2. Preheat your oven to 225-250F.
    - We want to cook it slowly over low heat so the beef melts in your mouth.
3. Dice the onion, dice the red bell pepper, and smash the garlic cloves. Chop the carrot into 1 inch chunks.
    - Always prepare everything before you start cooking. _Mise en place_.
4. Turn your stovetop on and crank it to medium/high (`6` for conventional ovens). Retrieve your favourite roasting pot. Pour in a couple teaspoons of vegetable oil and wait for it to start smoking, 5-10 minutes. Brown your beef on all sides, 2 minutes per side. Do not over-crowd. Put it to the side.
5. Turn down the stovetop to medium. Throw in the onion, bell pepper, garlic, carrot, and red pepper flakes. Cook for 3-5 minutes until slightly brown.
6. Put the beef back in and pour in the red wine, soy sauce, lemon juice, herbs, and vinegar. Stir and scrape the fond off the bottom of the pot. Pour in the beef stock until the beef is submerged by at least 75%.
7. Bring it to a light boil.
8. Cover the pot, slightly ajar and put it in the oven for 4-5 hours. 
9. Mashed potatoes is a great side to pair with the beef.
10. You know the beef is finished when it easily breaks apart with a fork. You should jump for joy when you taste it.
11. Gravy time. Take the beef and carrots out of the liquid. Pour the liquid through a sieve into a saucepan. Boil the liquid on high until it reduces into a thick gravy. Near the end, slowly incorporate the flour to thicken the gravy.
12. Turn down the stovetop to low. Put the beef and carrots into the saucepan, stir to combine, and cover for 15 minutes.
13. Enjoy!
